Perfwatcher-2.2 Release notes
=============================

Developers : Configuration for widgets
======================================
There is more control on json_item_datas array.
The data passed to the browser is now sent from lib/class.json_item_datas.php
to allow more control (and reduce the memory use).

Consequence for widgets : a new configuration item appears in the get_info()
method : 'db_config_key'. This is the name of the configuration item in the
database.
Check lib/class.*.php for examples.

Note : if you do not add 'db_config_key' there you will not be able to load
your configuration from the database.
