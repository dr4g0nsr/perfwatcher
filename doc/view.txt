About views

Views caracteristics
--------------------
- in the database, a tree where the root parent has parent_id = 1
- in the database, lines with the same view_id column
- in perfwatcher, a json_tree filled with nodes from the database with a specific view_id.
- in perfwatcher, the name of the view is the title of the root node of the
  view.

IMPORTANT : in the database, the id remains unique. There cannot be 2 lines
with distinct view_id and same id.

As a consequence, given an id, you can find the view_id.

Another consequence is that if you are looking for an id given the wrong
view_id, you will find nothing.

Example of requests in the database
-----------------------------------

Select all nodes of a view V in the database :
SELECT * FROM tree WHERE view_id = V;

Find the view_id given an id X :
SELECT view_id FROM tree WHERE id = X;
Note : the answer should be unique because id is unique.

Find the name of a view V :
SELECT title FROM tree WHERE view_id = V and parent_id = 1;

Get the list of views :
SELECT title FROM tree WHERE parent_id = 1;


Notes
-----

The view_id could be put in the 'datas' column with other information. It is
easier for programmers and probably for mysql optimizations to have this
number in a specific column.

The view_id of a node is the same as the view_id of its parent. So the
view_id can be known from the root node view_id. However, we prefer to set it
in a specific column, which makes it redundant, because it's easier to find
the whole tree of a view by filtering on that comlumn.
