Perfwatcher-2.1 Release notes
=============================

New Postgresql support
======================

First release with Postgresql support.
It has never been tested in Production environment. Maybe you want to wait
next release before using Postgresql support in Production, or prefer Mysql
for this release.


Aggregators can be disabled for some Collectd sources
=====================================================

In your etc/config.php, you can add a new parameter to Collectd sources
($collectd_sources) as "no_aggregator" => 1 (or "no_aggregator" => 'yes') to
disable aggregators for that source.

Check etc/config.sample.php for more information.


Copy a graph to the Windows clipboard
=====================================

On Internet Explorer, right click on a graph then "Copy Image". This will copy
the image to your Windows Clipboard and you will be able to paste it to
another application (Outlook, MSPaint, Word...)

Mozilla and Chrome users : your browser does not allow Javascript to copy an
image to the clipboard so you cannot copy as easily as on IE.

Workaroung for Mozilla users : you can [Shift][Ctrl][Right click] and you will get the usual
context menu including "Copy image".


Database update
===============

Collectd Source was defined inside the "datas" blob in Perfwatcher-2.0.
In Perfwatcher-2.1, it is moved to its own column "cdsrc".

Note 1 : only Containers can have a significant Collectd Source. It will be
ignored (or considered as a cache in future versions) for Selections and
Servers.

Note 2 : empty (null) cdsrc means that it inherits from parent.
