Perfwatcher-2.1 Release notes
=============================

New Postgresql support
======================

First release with Postgresql support.
It has never been tested in Production environment. Maybe you want to wait
next release before using Postgresql support in Production, or prefer Mysql
for this release.


Aggregators can be disabled for some Collectd sources
=====================================================

In your etc/config.php, you can add a new parameter to Collectd sources
($collectd_sources) as "no_aggregator" => 1 (or "no_aggregator" => 'yes') to
disable aggregators for that source.

Check etc/config.sample.php for more information.

Database update
===============

Collectd Source was defined inside the "datas" blob in Perfwatcher-2.0.
In Perfwatcher-2.1, it is moved to its own column "cdsrc".

Note 1 : only Containers can have a significant Collectd Source. It will be
ignored (or considered as a cache in future versions) for Selections and
Servers.

Note 2 : empty (null) cdsrc means that it inherits from parent.
