<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

<p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Q:</strong> Can Perfwatcher work with the original version of Collectd ?</li>
		<li><strong>R:</strong> Yes, but a lot of features will not work, particularly for the server/frontend side. At least for the server/frontend, you should use the patched collectd version we provide.</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Q:</strong> What is the difference between Collectd and Collectd-pw</li>
		<li>
			<strong>R:</strong> Collectd-pw is the latest version of Collectd (currently the 5.1) with a set 
			of patch to improve Collectd or adding some features nedeed by Perfwatcher. See <a href="collectd_patches.html">Collectd patches</a> for more information.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Q:</strong> Is this a fork of collectd ?</li>
		<li><strong>R:</strong> No. We have some specific needs for perfwatcher, so we need to maintain some patches that may not be included in the official Collectd. We also develop on Collectd and we think it is a good idea to implement our patches in the Collectd-pw. We hope those patches will be included in next versions of collectd and that we will not have to maintain them as patches any longer.</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Q:</strong> How many servers can be monitored with Collectd / PerfWatcher ?</li>
		<li><strong>R:</strong> The limit is your server. Collectd is hightly scallable and can be load-balanced. Actually I have 5600 servers monitored by 1 Collectd server at work.</li>
